# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression ❤️

This project implements a **Logistic Regression** model to predict the presence of heart disease based on medical features.

---

## 📌 Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not.  
The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using standard machine learning metrics.

## 🧠 Model Used
- Logistic Regression

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
- Data loading and exploration
- Feature scaling
- Train-test split
- Model training
- Model evaluation

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
The model performance is evaluated using:
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- ROC Curve
- Precision-Recall Curve

---

## 🛠️ Libraries
- Python
